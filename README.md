<br/>

This project aims to digitize and automate the process of generating certificates like transfer certificates (TC) and conduct certificates (CC) for students in educational institutions.

Many schools and colleges currently maintain student records manually on paper, making it tedious and time-consuming to search through documents when certificates are requested. This website will allow institutions to store student information in a database online.

#### Key features

- Admin dashboard to manage student records, class/section details
- Searchable database to quickly lookup student information
- Auto-generate TC and CC in standard formats with student details populated
- Print or download certificates in PDF format
- Track certificate requests and generation status
- Secure access control for admin users

This project will benefit educational institutions by reducing paperwork, improving efficiency and making the TC/CC issuance process faster and more convenient. Institutions can maintain digital records that are easily accessible, securely stored and can be utilized for automation.
